    FOLLY TREE ARBORETUM WINS ARCHITECT'S NEWSPAPER "BEST OF DESIGN" AWARD FOR UNBUILT CULTURAL CIVIC EDUCATION
    “Strangeness abounds in this proposal to add on to an existing barn. The design, with its lofted shingle roof, is a hybrid cultivated from architectural references like New England barns, Gwathmey modernism, and contemporary formalisms. The resulting spaces, expertly rendered, are weird and compelling.” —Jack Murphy

    TORONTO TOWNHOUSE WINS ARCHITECT'S NEWSPAPER "BEST OF DESIGN" AWARD FOR INTERIOR RESIDENTIAL
    “The elegant and clever figural void strategy integrates circulation and light and is literally a breath of fresh air into the otherwise dark townhouse typology. Soft geometric transformations of the void across the vertical spaces creates moments of domestic wonder.” —Tei Carpenter

    Juror William Massie praised the overall analysis as “extending thoughts of materials and the history and science of building.”
    
    “What I really liked about this was this notion of digital fabrication and handcraft coming together,...it is an interesting integration of old methods and new ways of thinking that could, in fact, overlap to other aspects of craft and building.”
    - Sylvia Smith

LAMAS is an award winning architecture studio registered in the US and Canada. We have worked in a range of scales, from ground-up residential houses to manufacturing and commercial spaces. We are practitioners and academics, equally invested in pragmatics and discursive research. Together with our energetic staff, we explore ornament, color, optical illusions, and craft traditions with advanced technology.

LAMAS was a 2014 finalist for MoMA PS1 Young Architects Program. We were named “Next Progressives” by Architect Magazine in 2017. Our work has won the 2017 Architizer+ Award, 2011 R+D Award and has been cited by Dwell Magazine, I.D. Magazine, and ACSA Faculty Design Awards. Our practice is backed by 16 years of combined experience as project managers for SHoP Architects and Gluck+. We have designed and led those teams to earn P/A Awards and the 2013 National AIA Housing Award. 

LAMAS was founded by (link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OTuDdku1YVjwDUSCNuomXflaMn49qxcbG38-xQK4iPs/edit?usp=sharing text:  Vivian Lee) and (link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/192DvZ2uwwjm7ffkIlU8QHOgAOUcDmRQXSAeUtdkYnb8/edit?usp=sharing text: James Macgillivray).
