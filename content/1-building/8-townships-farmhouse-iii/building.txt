Text: This farmhouse starts with a basic courtyard configuration that is arranged in an asymmetrical pinwheel. The volumes are stitched together by a system of axial views to the landscape. These axes are the organizational principle of both the internal arrangement and facade design. Large pocket doors on the ground floor as well as moving fence panels open up the central axis of the courtyard like the dooryard and aisle of a traditional barn.
