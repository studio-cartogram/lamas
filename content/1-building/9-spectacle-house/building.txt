Text: The house occupies a difficult site between a protected wetland and an old summer camp on a lake in western Connecticut. It opens up to views of the lake and woods alternately with a stepped form in plan and section; the walls change direction based on the predominant views. The lower level displays the excavation of table rock with light from the kitchen greenhouse above.
