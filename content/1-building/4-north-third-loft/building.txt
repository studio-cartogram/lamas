Text: The North-Third Loft is a 1,200 sf.ft. renovation designed for a musician/banker couple. The building was formerly a mill - one of the many old industrial buildings along the Brooklyn waterfront - bringing with it the challenges of rehabilitating an old neglected space but also a wealth of industrial details. Steel columns, steel and wood beams, brick walls and original wood floor were all exposed, stripped and often repaired.
