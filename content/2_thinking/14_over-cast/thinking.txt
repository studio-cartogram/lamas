Text: Over Cast is a solidification of distant air brought close, a piece of man-made sky in the sky. It is cast in the form of a coffered ceiling, lifted and reflected to infinity over the the Chicago landscape like an endlessly expanding chunk of firmament. The overhead expanse spreads out and serves as a civic canopy for many activities and all seasons.
