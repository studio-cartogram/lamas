Text: Art Toronto invited LAMAS to reconceptualize and design the layout of Art Toronto 2015. The design concept focused on the legibility of the art fair through section and plan based figure making. Section Mountains, Plan Shapes and Tilt-boxes are immediately identifiable spaces that motivate the viewersâ€™ circulation and lead them through the fair and its events.
