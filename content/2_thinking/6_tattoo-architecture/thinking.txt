Text: Hydrographics is the method by which artwork or pattern can be imprinted onto complex surfaces through aqueous transfer. Invented in 1974 but only popularized in the last two decades for the decoration of automobiles and weaponry, this application opens architecture up to the uncharted potential for a collaboration between curvilinear surfaces and optical graphics for new spatial effects and material misregistration.
