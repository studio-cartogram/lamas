Text: A simple repeating tile pattern formed by two back-to-back semi-circles. Repeated in one orientation it reads as flat circles. Turned 90 degrees and the field starts to take on shaded dimensional depth; stacked circles now appear to be overlapping. The graphic array is further nuanced by a range of six pixelated resolutions. From hi to lo-res, a customer can choose how to strategically alter the reality of the flat floor plane. Slightly jarring and yet conventional, Hilores adds visual excitement by activating the viewerâ€™s perception, questioning and accentuating the sharpness of all the objects in the room.
