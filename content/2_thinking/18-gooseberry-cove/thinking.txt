Text: The proposed lookout is situated at the juncture of an inland stream and a wide shallow bay. The structure is simple; volumes drawn from views of the surrounding landscape and migratory birds intersect to create the space of rooms. The soaring line of a seam between two surfaces traverses the ceiling like a migrating bird.
