Text: Following up on our thatching research, Grasses for Glasses appropriates the material characteristics of thatch into a hair object that wears glasses on the one face while revealing a pattern of porosity and light from its inner sanctum. The result is a field of indeterminate fuzziness, illuminated by bright shelves of floating eyewear and slivers of reflected customers. A smattering of ‘tongues’ emerge from the furred surface, bringing anthropomorphic humor to this landscape while flaunting some of the most iconic eyewear pieces.
