Text: SLACK conceives of the curtain as flexible both in plan and section. By varying the height of both the curtain and the rod that it hangs from, SLACK engenders a new spatial relationship between the curtain and the space it separates. When closed the fabric of the curtain is custom shaped in order to take up the difference of the track’s elevation. Thus the bottom edge of the curtain maintains a 40” datum throughout the entire space. However, if the curtain is opened or if it shifts along its length, what was once a perfect fit becomes just the opposite: slack appears at key moments in the plan and droops down to the ground like the abundant train of a wedding dress to create columns or walls of cloth.
