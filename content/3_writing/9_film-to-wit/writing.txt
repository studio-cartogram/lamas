Excerpt: This work lays out a handful of filmic spaces as in a cabinet of curiosities. Spheres, pyramids, tapestries, lattices and prisms among others â€“ all are latent in film. By bringing these figures out of the dark, fleeting confines of the cinema and into architectural representation, the project points towards unforeseen as yet untapped potentials for view, projection and enclosure.
