Excerpt: Works of art and architecture are always subject to a process of translation and reinscription when they are depicted in cinema. This process is demonstrated through a detailed analysis of a scene in Andrei Tarkovsky's Nostalghia which features the Madonna del Parto by Piero della Francesca. While analyzing the effect of suture and cinematic space on architecture, the author shows how Tarkovsky consciously changes the meaning of Piero's fresco and its surrounding architecture as he reinscribes them in his film.
