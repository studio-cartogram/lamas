(story: **Sister's my new mother, Mother. **And is it just me or is she looking hotter? It's so watery. And yet there's a smack of ham to it.)

(story: **Do you have any idea how often you say the word afraid?** Well, I know I used it in the Jacuzzi. She's a contestant. It's sorta like an inner beauty pageant. Ah, there it is. She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways. https://getkirby.com/docs/content/text#basic-formats She's trying to prove that she's closer to my children than I am, but the joke's on her, because she doesn't know how little I care for GOB. Oh, yes, there absolutely will be a margarita made in my mouth. *I run a pretty tight ship around here*. With a pool table. It's a gaming ship.

<blockquote>The only thing I found in the fridge was a dead dove in a bag. Gob: You didn't eat that, did you? I've got a nice hard cot with his name on it. You'd do that to your own brother? I said "cot."</blockquote>)

(story: <blockquote>Shémale. I don't care if it takes from now till the end of Shrimpfest.</blockquote> 
That's the first time we were in the shower since our honeymoon. And this time, no tears. She's not that https://getkirby.com/docs/content/text#basic-formats Mexican, Mom. She's my Mexican. And she's Columbian or something. The only thing more terrifying than the escaped lunatic's hook was his twisted call… Hey campers! Big yellow joint, big yellow joint, I'll meet you down at the big yellow joint. Yeah, like anyone would want to R her. With spicy club sauce.)

(story: Well, Michael, I did not find their buffoonery amusing. I know what it feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite. It's like my heart is getting hard. Her lawyers are claiming the seal is worth $250,000. And that's not even including Buster's Swatch. How could I say no to the woman who gave me chlamydia? You can always tell a Milford man. Happy Franklin Friday. Oh, I can just taste those meaty leading man parts in my mouth.

In the mid '90s, Tobias formed a folk music band with Lindsay and Maebe which he called Dr. Funke's 100 Percent Natural Good Time Family Band Solution. The group was underwritten by the Natural Food Life Company, a division of Chem-Grow, an Allen Crayne acqusition, which was part of the Squimm Group. Their motto was simple: We keep you alive. Ohhh little guy. The tears aren't coming. The tears just aren't coming. It's so watery. And yet there's a smack of ham to it.)

(story: I am getting rid of this thing. It has caused me nothing but pride and self-respect. I'm gonna build me an airport, put my name on it. **Why, Michael?** So you can fly away from your feelings? After all, why should you go to jail for a crime somebody else noticed? I was set up. *By the Brits*. A group of British builders operating outside the O.C. George Bush doesn't care about black puppets.)
