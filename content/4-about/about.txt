Heading: Transforming Vernacular into Spectacular

----

Text: 

###Proudly Based in Toronto Canada

We start with the ordinary. Vernacular forms, modest materials, obsolete types, old movies, craft traditions — They seem to reside in the background but over time become unique. Like when you keep repeating a word until it detaches itself from language and begins to sound interesting or absurd. 

This is the ground that we draw inspiration from. We are fascinated by the commonplace but somewhere along the way our fascination changed it into something new. We have filled out the space of a camera's arc, created barns with too many doors, a porous thatch hut, and a Venetian villa without a center. Each project involves a transformation in the deep tectonics of the thing we started with; the results are surprising and playful yet uncommonly ordinary.

LAMAS was a 2014 finalist for MoMA PS1 Young Architects Program. Our work has won the 2011 R+D Award and has received honorable mentions in I.D. Magazine, Architizer+ Awards, and ACSA Faculty Design Awards. Our film projects have been shown in NYC at Urban Exquis: A Cinematic Installation in First Street Green and at the Telluride International Experimental Cinema Exposition in Colorado. As project managers for SHoP Architects and Gluck+, we have designed and led our teams to earn P/A Awards and the 2013 National AIA Housing Award.

    The creative force behind LAMAS, are
    involved in the wide range of projects.
    Staying true to the principles of good
    design and the heritage of
    craftsmanship, they produce not only
    tasteful buildings, but also design
    interiors. They have recently gathered a
    broad media attention for designing
    Annex Apartment in Toronto. While
    representing a contemporary vision,
    LAMAS sticks to the traditional
    craftsmanship and often finds
    inspiration in the past.

  description: 'LAMAS — the small, Toronto-based studio of Vivian Lee and James Macgilivray is a perfect blend of its founders sensibilities: aesthetics outlined by minimal, well-considered forms and explorations into tactile, human materials. The duo have been on our radar since their Townships Farmhouse projects.'
