Text: “Big house, little house, back house, barn” is a New England farmhouse configuration that dates back to the 18th century. This farmhouse design modifies the connected farm by replacing the sequential aggregation with one of coincident interference. Several houses all exist simultaneously and in the same place. At the moments of greatest agglomeration the building plays host to a variety of competing volumes.
