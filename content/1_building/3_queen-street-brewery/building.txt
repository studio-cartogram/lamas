Text: A renovation of an old A&P supermarket, Avling Kitchen and Brewery draws inspiration from the “field to glass” principle of early breweries. The concept was to deliver a clean, bright inclusive space. Fields of activity are delineated by larger than life 3x6 raw wood frames, pink steel, and optic fields of lights, glazing and a custom mural. On the roof of the building is a 400 square meter vegetable and herb garden. The roof is integral to the function of the whole building and maintains a connection to the name Avling, Norwegian for harvest. The mural by Madison van Rijn reinterprets the crop fields of rural Ontario as color fields, patterning the walls with forms on the verge of recognition.
