Text: A gut renovation of a typical Toronto semi-attached Townhouse. The design focused on a geometric lightwell that organized the domestic spaces, starting at the kitchen cabinetry and ending at the childrenâ€™s play space. The geometry climbs through the four stories reverberating curves through plan and elevation, describing a dramatic void that also conceals necessary bulkheads.
