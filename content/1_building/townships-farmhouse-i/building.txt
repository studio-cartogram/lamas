Title: Townships Farmhouse I

Text: This design for a farmhouse starts with the basic courtyard arrangement, but departs from it by the strict imposition of four contradictory elevations. These elevations result in the projection of a ghosted barn structure, similar to a tobacco barn, on the diagonal. The internal rotation opens the courtyard to southern exposure but also binds all the volumes of the house in an ever more constrained geometrical unity.
