Text: LAMAS worked with Lakeside Collaborative to design and fabricate a kiosk for Lincoln Center. During the summer months the kiosk features products designed by Small Stuff for Lincoln Center's first branded campaign. LAMAS incorporated translucent fabric with a custom alumninum frame and integrated battery powered lighting system. Although we echoed the iconic arches of Lincoln Center with the form of the kiosk, the materials are distinctly lighter.
